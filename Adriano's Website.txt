Challenges and Solutions
1.Problem: It was difficult to use inline, internal, and external CSS without making the code messy or affecting consistency.
Solution: Applied external CSS for most styling, added internal CSS for unique section styling, and used inline CSS only for simple one-line overrides (like changing a background color).
2.Problem: Achieving responsive 2-column (About page) and 3-column (Projects page) layouts that look good on both desktop and mobile.
Solution: Used Flexbox for the About page and CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax for the Projects page to ensure responsiveness. Tested layouts on different screen sizes to verify they stack correctly.
3.Problem: greetUser() in the homepage didnâ€™t run because it was called before the script was loaded.
Solution: Moved the function call inside the DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure the DOM and script were fully loaded before execution.
